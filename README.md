# CSCC01Lab1
# I pushed all of my individual files present in the ToDoList folder in the repo instead of the folder itself. That was because when I tried pushing the folder itself with all  of its contents, the folder became an unopenable submodule.

# Also the repo is name CSCC01Lab1 instead of C01Lab1 since I had to create a new repo for the same reason as mentioned above
